## About My Data Structure
I used binary search to implement sqrt.
Because I think I can calculate sqrt to
find an approximation value which is
calculated by continuing one plus one and divided by 2.

## Time and Space
The order is O(logn) because of using binary search.
As to space, there is not wasted or duplicated data.
So, it is OK!
