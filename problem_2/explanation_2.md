## About My Data Structure
I used binary search to search for rotation pivot and target value.
Althought the binary search need sorted values,
I can tell given values is almost sorted.
So, once I find rotation pivot, I can search for target value by using binary search.

## Time and Space
The order is O(logn) because of using binary search.
As to space, there is not wasted or duplicated data.
So, it is OK!
