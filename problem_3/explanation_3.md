## About My Data Structure
I used heap sort to sort by ascending order.
Then I calculate maximum sum to use this sorted values.
But I just only combine odd number with the other odd number,
and, even number with the other even number.

## Time and Space
The order is O(nlogn) because of using heap sort.
As to space, there is not wasted or duplicated data.
So, it is OK!
